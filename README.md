<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Create a resource group and virtual machines
- Observe ICMP Traffic
- Configuring a Firewall (Network Security Group)
- Observing different types of network traffic

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

1. Create a resource group within Microsoft Azure

2. Create a Windows 10 and Linux Virtual Machine
- Make sure both VMs are on the same resource group and virtual network/subnet (the virtual network was created while creating Windows 10 VM because it was the first one that was done)

3. Within your Windows 10 Virtual Machine, Install Wireshark

4. Open Wireshark and start packet capture
- Within Wireshark, filter for ICMP traffic only
- Then, retrieve the private IP address of the Ubuntu VM (linux-vm) and attempt to ping it from within the Windows 10 VM 
- Observe ping requests and replies within Wireshark

5. Open the Network Security Group your Ubuntu VM is using and disable incoming (inbound) ICMP traffic

6. Back in the Windows 10 VM, observe the ICMP traffic in Wireshark and the command-line Ping activity
- You will see that the ping request timed out because of the blocked ICMP traffic

7. Re-enable ICMP traffic for the Network Security Group that your Ubuntu VM is in
- Back in the Windows 10 VM, observe the ICMP traffic in Wireshark and the command line Ping activity (should start working)

8. Back in Wireshark, start a packet capture within the Windows 10 VM
- Filter for SSH traffic only
- Open PowerShell, and type: ssh labuser@<private IP address>
- This will allow you to log in to the Linux VM

9. Back in Wireshark, filter for DNS traffic only
- From your Windows 10 VM within a command line, use nslookup to see what Disney.comâ€™s IP addresses are, for example
- Observe the DNS traffic being shown in Wireshark

<img width="2559" height="1439" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-22 134626" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79ff40f0-213a-437f-bce9-7219e576ce08" />

10. Back in Wireshark, filter for RDP traffic only (tcp.port == 3389)
- Observe the immediate non-stop spam of traffic
- However, there is non-stop spamming traffic instead of only showing traffic when you do an activity.
- This is because the RDP (protocol) is constantly showing you a live stream from one computer to another; therefore, traffic is always being transmitted
